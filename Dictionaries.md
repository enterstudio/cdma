# Introduction #

This section is intended to documents the CDMA keywords used through the dictionary mechanism.
Each data item in a data set is identified by a unique keyword.
The CDMA dictionary should apply for Photon and Neutron science.

It contains, like the CIF dictionary, a core dictionary with generic keywords, and extensions that applies to specific experimental technics (SAX, EXAFS, Powder diffraction,...)

At this early stage, this is a tentative list:

  * [Core dictionary](CoreDict.md)
  * [Small-angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) extension](SAXSDict.md)
  * [X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) extension](XASDict.md)
  * [X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) extension](XRFDict.md)
  * [Powder diffraction extension](PowderDiffrDict.md)
  * [Tomography extension](TomoDict.md)
